IEEE Envision Project Assignments for Mentees

## Instructions:
1. Clone this repo using:
```console
git clone https://github.com/harry7337/EnvisionAssignments.git
```
2. Create your own branch( you can name it anything but preferably use your name) and checkout to that branch.
#### Tip: You can achieve create a new branch and switch to it using a single command!

3. Create a folder in your name and copy the notebook to that folder. This is the file you will be making changes to.

4. Start solving the assignment. If you are stuck at any point stackoverflow and the docs of the respective libraries will definitely help you. Don't be shy to reach out to us.

5. If you want to save your progress(which we recommend that you do that often), commit your changes using the commit command and add a message.
```console
git commit -m "your-msg-here"
```

6. If you want the changes to reflect on the repo(on your branch specifically), be sure to push them. 
```console
git push
```
- If there is an error popping up, you might have to set the upstream:
```console
git push --set-upstream origin <your-branch-name>
```
OR
```console
git push --u origin <your-branch-name>
```
All consequent commands need not require you use the `-u` option.

7. Once you are finished with the assingments, head over to github and move over to the Pull Request Tab. Compare your branch to the main branch and submit a pull request.

8. Good Luck!
